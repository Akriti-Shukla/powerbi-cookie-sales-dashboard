### Project Workflow

1. Data Preparation

- Imported two core datasets: Orders and Customers.
- Removed unnecessary columns to simplify the data model and improve performance.
- Ensured data types were consistent and accurate for analysis.

2. Date Table Creation
- To enable proper time intelligence functions and filtering, a dynamic date table was created:


  ```dax
  Dim_Date = 
    CALENDAR(
    DATE(2024, 12, 01), 
    CALCULATE(MAX('Orders'[Order Date]))
    )
  ```


- Established a one-to-many relationship between dim_Date[Date] and Orders[Order Date].


3. DAX Measures

   Created below given essential key measures:


```dax
Total Orders = COUNTROWS(Orders)
Total Sales = SUM(Orders[Revenue])
```
